## Presentation
I present you my video-game, named Sumo Spheres, developed with Unity and C++.

You play as a ball on a platform and other balls want to knock you off this platform. Your goal is to survive as long as you can. Good luck and have fun! 

There is two game modes: a round-based solo mode against AIs and an online multiplayer mode to play with your friends.

NB: My personal record is 21 in the solo mode. It becomes difficult because the AIs get stronger and faster after each round.

## How to play ?
The game is downloadable for MacOS and Windows in the "Executables" folder of this repository.

## GLHF !
